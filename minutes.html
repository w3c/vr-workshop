<h2 class="c0 c5" id="h.8txo5caxxo3q"><span>implementation status,
obstacles, future plans</span></h2>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Megan: we'll start with an intro from Brandon
on WebVR status and then go into implementation status from
implementers</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c8 c14">Brandon Jones, Google</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This is a quick intro on what WebVR is and
where the different browsers are at.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>A brief history: this whole WebVR thing
literally started in a Tweet exchange, with Vlad suggesting how to
plug a browser into the first Oculus kit. It seems so consensually
Web to me: no funding, no managerial discussion - just two guys
doing it in their free time. And look where we're at - that's the
kind of innovation the Web enables.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The initial version of the spec was very
different from what we see today - it was based on the hardware
available then, built around DK1 (DK2 was not available
yet).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The API has been changing a lot, with lots of
cooperation between vendors. It's getting better and better. What
we've called 1.0 has been revised to get up to par with the latest
hardware. Microsoft has jumped in to contribute to the spec, Oculus
announced WebVR support.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The state of the art is what we call WebVR 1.1
- which is likely the last version to be numbered - it will just be
WebVR after that. This new version is based on great feedback from
Microsoft to make sure WebVR can work with their platform, removing
guess work for the developers and tightening up
behaviors.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There are more non-backwards compatible changes
that are upcoming - but we have to do them now. We're getting
feedback from lots of people doing VR, feedback to make sure we
have the right set of capabilities for the long term.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We are working on bringing Web Worker
compatibility which is quite important - the main thread in
JavaScript is a big mess, and workers allow to remove some of that
constraint, even to the cost of backwards compat. We're also
getting feedback from a Web-platform perspective, making sure we
get the right model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What's next? At a mundane level, we want to
keep extending the API - VR layers; we want to allow more WebGL
extensions targeted for VR (e.g. multiviews). WebGL 2 is going to
come out reasonably around the same time of WebVR. And likewise, we
want to get ready for WebGL next.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We also need to keep track of evolutions in the
VR hardware.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We also need to focus on tooling - there were
great announcements from Oculus recently. Some people were asking
about this as being a competition to what I've beeqn working on -
but it's a non-issue, it's actually great - nobody is trying to get
control or take over the ecosystem. We need more tools, more
browsers, more support for people who want to build content. There
is no bad side to doing that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We have decades experience in the browser which
we have been ignoring - we need to bring Web & VR to get
closer.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We need to look into support new media formats
that are VR native - gltf (not specific to VR, but better support
in browsers would be fantastic). New media formats for video and
audio that are very spatially aware with lots of info on the
environment - we don't want every single developers to reinvent how
to get that on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We need to make sure audio is a first class
citizen in VR - there is lots of interesting innovation on the
audio side. Good VR without audio is missing half the point - it
should not be an afterthought.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We want to make sure the Web enables AR
scenarios. [screenshot of hololens user]. WE want to enable full
use of capabilities of Hololens or Tango capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the end, we really need to think about how
to move past this of the current VR experience of a modal app - VR
is a very exclusive thing where you launch an app, you use it for a
while, and then you move to something else. If we want VR to be a
general computing platform, we need to move beyond that. It's
extremely important, especially for the Web.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Most people here would agree we're not where we
want to be for VR yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>How do enable composition of activities, allow
overlap and still keep it functional. This will require lots of
experimentations and failures, but we will get there.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<h2 class="c0 c5" id="h.ublgoxvl4cwz"><span>Browser
updates</span></h2>
<p class="c0"><span>Megan Lindsay - update on Chrome. &nbsp;We are
building support for WebVR 1.1 in Chrome for Android, including the
game extensions. We're targeting M56 for</span> <span class=
"c9"><a class="c4" href=
"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vr.google.com/daydream/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1477062934647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_QGr-lDN1doGi6NjUxU-Mg7vf0Q">
daydream</a></span><span>, should be in beta in December, and
stable release in January. We will first release as an origin trial
- web sites need to request a (free) token to get access to the
API.</span> <span class="c9"><a class="c4" href=
"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6331324939894784&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1477062934647000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqmyXwQYtFC7SnN5MdPcpFi4reXA">
Origin trials:</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The API is still changing quite a bit, so this
enables us to get feedback from developers before a stable
release.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There will also be cardboard support coming
soon.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We're also working on WebVR in Chrome for
Windows desktop, with plans to support both Rift and Vive - not
sure if we're targeting M56 or 57, as origin trial.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Beyond WebVR, we're working on a version of
Chrome that supports browsing in VR for regular 2D sites. Timeline
towards first half of 2017 for daydream, with later support for
desktop.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We're also interested in standardization on
360° videos, and we also want to look beyond WebGL with declarative
VR. We want to enable existing web sites to add VR features without
a complete rewrite.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We also want to look at AR but we're not sure
what this would entail yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c8 c14">Frank Olivier,
Microsoft</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>WebVR is in development for Microsoft Edge, it
will be coming up in an insider release at some point. It's built
on Windows holographic APIs. We are also very interested in
advancing the specifications - we think there will be needs in this
space for years to come.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If you maintain WebVR content, we're definitely
interested in running it in our browser, to test it beyond our test
suite.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Justin Rogers, Oculus</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Carmel Developer Preview based on chromium m55
should come pretty soon, with support for WebVR 1.1, and limited
support for Gamepad. Target Gear VR and Touch controler. No 3D
motion integration.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In Nov 2016, developer release of Carmel, and
of React VR.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We'll do another update with M56 in Jan/Feb
2017</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We will work with other partners also work in
other browsers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Chris Van Wiemeersch, Mozilla<br>
We started in 2014 as an experimental project based on Brandon and
Vlad's work, who is also involved in WebGL. We had an API and
wanted to see if we could render content in a browser.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The workflow is: you go to a Web site, you
click on a VR button and you switch to a stereopscopic
view.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This was a demonstration that this was
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It wasn't until Justin Rogers did a hackathon
with a deep dive on the PoC API, and made lots of great suggestions
to improve performance, developers ergonomics and API.</span>

WebVR Community Group</a></span> <span>- it has 100+ participants,
it's free, chaired by Brandon and myself.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As we introduced more hardware support, we had
to update a number of our assumption in the APIs.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>WebVR is getting a lot of legitimacy with
"native" VR developers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Casey and @@@ worked on a prototype of what a
VR browser would look like, demonstrating e.g. how to click on a
link, transitioning to a new view.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This is built around iframes - we don't have
hooks for handling navigation transitions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We created a backwards-compatible VR browser to
find deficiencies in the WebVR API.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the demo, we navigate in regular 2D pages,
controlled by Xbox; when moving to a 3D page, it switches to
immersive 3D view. This made us realize of some deficiencies in the
tooling - that's where a-frame came in: it catalyzes the creation
of content and also helped us assess the API is viable.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>[these examples show VR doesn't have to be
gaming or action oriented - it can be meditative]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>[this demo illustrates the performance and
interactivity you can get in Web browsers for high end
VR]</span></p>

browsers, support for the various APIs - it's collaboratively
maintained, including by other browser vendors.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Casey Yee, Mozilla</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It's crazy to see all the work that has been
happening for past couple of years. The platform work is headed up
by Kip @@@ who couldn't make it today - I'm speaking on his
behalf.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>A lot of the focus has been around getting the
API implemented, making it work in our browser. The APIs are
available in Nightly, with support for HTC5, Oculus Rift, and
working on OSVR(?) support.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>As we continue with implementation, we are
trying to get a pipeline and process to bring these APIs in
production form. We have 1.0 API support, and we're planning to
have these APIs available in the stable browser for Firefox 51,
available in Q12017.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It will be available in a production browser,
so available to lots of developers - which is very
exciting.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>It's going through our beta API
program.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Beside performances, we have been working with
other teams needed for VR: audio, gamepad, WebRTC for co-presence -
lots of exciting things coming up.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Laszlo Gombos, Samsung</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>I'm going to talk mostly about mobile VR - as
enabled by Gear VR.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The Gear VR has an external touch pad, and an
external usb port which enables to plug more input
devices.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Gear VR has pretty large field of view, it has
improved tracking - when docked, it doesn't use the mobile device
sensors but its own IMU.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We built a VR-first browser - it not only
supports WebVR, but it also enables browsing the regular Web in VR.
For instance, to consume existing medias in VR - kind of the TV use
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This is good way to get people hooked up on VR
content.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We try to take advantage of the space around
you for interactions.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This shipped in Dec 2015, 10 months ago. We got
pretty positive feedback.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>First stable release in March 2016, with WebVR
support based on M44 Chromium. The WebVR support has to be enabled
specifically though.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We are 1.0 since April, and our latest release
was in August.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This is a VR-only product that users have to
download - we reached over 1M downloads!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If you are in mobile and in the samsung
browser, watching content/video, and dock the mobile in the
headset, we will switch you seamlessly to the VR
browser.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We support voice input for text. We have
curated content.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We have an extension of HTML video
support.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We allow the Web page itself ot change the
environment (e.g. show a background scene image around the browser
window in immersive view) - this is already shipping, the skybox
JavaScript API. “Progressive enhancement” from 2d Web.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>[showing demo of Skybox API]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What's next: we want to enable WebVR by
default, which requires improving performance; we want to bring
more control to the VR environment e.G. with the Skybox
API.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Discussing what bringing the latest
improvements of Web Platform to VR is also quite exciting to me
(e.g. Progressive Web Apps).</span></p>

browsers</span></h1>
<h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.y1dwoy6x4yo6"><span>Designing the browser
(Josh Carpenter, Google)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span>Josh - been working on figuring out how we want
the experience of surfing the web with a VR headset. As designer,
want to create possibilities - create the conditions so others can
make experiences.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>By the way - that (demoed on screen) is all
CSS.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>“Cambrian explosion” of browsers. For years
we’ve been trying to cram browsers in those tiny screens. In
comparison - VR is an infinite canvas! We are about to see an
explosion in browsers.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What are the things we think all browsers
should do consistently? Somewhere between pure freedom and a few
guard rails:</span></p>
<ul class="c6 lst-kix_ci5td4zaubdl-0 start">
<li class="c0 c2"><span>Avoid dead zones - give developers freedom
to design</span></li>
<li class="c0 c2"><span>Facilitate speed - this is where the web
can compete (not necessarily graphics but speed, especially speed
of loading). Show demos of transitions.</span></li>

(Chris Van Wiemeersch, Casey Yee, Mozilla)</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span>Casey and Chris. Colleagues at Mozilla. Always
wanted to move between content in VR. Hyperlink is a fundamental
portion of what we think the web should be, want to port that to
Web VR.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Web evolution. Move from Page to
World.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Our responsibility, what we have to do to
preserve future of the web as we know it:</span></p>
<ul class="c6 lst-kix_hgrss6dlgoht-0 start">
<li class="c0 c2"><span>User Control - choice of where to go and
how to get there</span></li>
<li class="c0 c2"><span>Security - no surprises. Protect the user
from bad surprises, cross scripting etc</span></li>
<li class="c0 c2"><span>Openness - enforces interop. Make sure
these aspects of navigation remain</span></li>

<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Want to talk about hand tracking and
interaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Quote Brandon Jones: “</span><span class=
"c13">They watch some demos or play a game and walk away saying how
impressive it is, but almost everyone makes a remark about how they
wish they had hands</span><span>.”</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Today’s techniques generally using depth
camera. Create depth map.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Two kinds of hand tracking: skeleton tracking
and cursor tracking</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Demo of skeleton hand tracking - for avatar
hand tracking. More computing intensive, thus challenging for
mobile devices as it impacts the battery life and may introduce
latency. No standards for this today, typically using websockets.
Area for standards?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Cursor tracking models the hand as one pointer
in space. Lighter weight, requires less computing, and can be more
stable and accurate which makes it better for accurate UI
control.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Another aspect is gesture recognition. This
delivers high level events. Recent trend to use hardware
acceleration to handle this. This area is quite heavily patented,
could be problematic.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Want to talk about Ray Input. But first, go
back to 1998. The web had Pages, scrollbars, blue links etc.
Imagine if we only had a mouse and no interaction standards to
start with?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>2016 VR world? Yeah, that. What should the
input patterns be? Currently a lot of experimentation, which is
both good and frustrating for end users.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Opening the floor. Potch reads questions from

<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>1.</span> <span>How do you bridge the gap
[didn’t get details]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Nell - tell me more about what you’d like to
see?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>2. Question on raycasting. How do you have arm
model without extra input?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Boris: heuristics based on fixed offset between
head and elbow.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>3. Also on raycasting. How do we borrow more
interactions from 3D game developers. Look to huge library of 3d
games and borrow beyond interaction with basic pointers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Boris: still very new</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>4. Philip S - great start, but there are so
many other interaction patterns we want to bring in and make
reusable. Maybe topic for breakout tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>(Brandon - there’s a slack channel we just
created)</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>5. Jim Bricker - question on gesture control:
anyone thought of using device everyone already knows
(smartphone)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ningxin: depends on smartphone vendors adding
the right sensors.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>6 Potch: how do we find basic standard set of
gesture given cultural variety</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Ningxin: [missed response]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Philip S: interesting thing we’ve done: hand
facing out interacts with the world, looking at palm of your hand
shows menu</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>7. Sean W: worth thinking on IEEE VR, not to
copy them but worth adopting some of their work on e.g.
click</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>8. Question for Samsung folks on skybox: can
you do things like gradients.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Mike: you can generate color image dynamically,
etc. Sharing details on slack.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>9. Chris vW: how do you imagine implementation
of [??] (skybox, scribe assumes?)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Laszlo: you have basically HTTP headers, meta
tags or js. Discussion on which one you want. Our intent would be
to standardise.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>10: Nat Brown (Valve): not enough thinking
about room scale. Transition important in larger areas.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch - leads us to goals of this session -
identifying need for basic primitives. Maybe better primitives for
location and room scale.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: reiterates needs for common
primitives, using the idea of scrollbar as example. This is like
native apps where they all control differently. There is value to
that, to having things purpose built. But we want to give the web
primitives that work in more predictable way.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Philip S: we also should think about AR at the
same time, because it is different - there are objects in the world
you want to interact with. Need to think about that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>LucC: unifying by thinking of AR as different
only in transparency?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: main difference is environmental
knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Nell: if you’re not trying to bound user to
where they are in environment, none of this is hard. Transparency
is only a piece of that. Simultaneous connection to reality of
place too.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Chris vW: webVR is the more mature of the
immersive APIs. But we’re going towards 3D browsers, while
developers are used to 2D. It’s really about getting the web into
3rd dimension, not just about VR, AR, MR. 3D web.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Philip S: want to add to the AR discussion. In
a VR world everything is in that world. Different interactive
distributed simulated environment.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Diego: 1 to 1 mapping of space to movement for
room scale environments. Ability to integrate real objects into the
VR world. We can explore this.</span></p>

include auditory, cognitive, neuro;ogical, phsicial, speech,

<p class="c0"><span>Needs to be part of all aspects.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Multimodal: Accessibilty is inherently
providing information from modality in another.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Both inputs and outputs need to be
accessible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Example, an accessible shopping experience. If
one user uses gloves to interact with video, another visually
impaired user might have self-voicing option. Proximity. More
detail. Speech input,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Consider multiple disabilities, e.g.
deaf-blind. May need another input or one that hasn’t yet been
invented.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Consider all the inputs in a shopping
experience. Sight, touch, description; how would we present the
“shop for a dress” experience to all the senses, including for
someone who lacks some of those senses.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Make accessibility a first-class citizen. Work
with accessibility groups.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Built accessibility use cases, look for ways
general interfaces support accessibility.</span></p>

<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>I’m from Awe Media. Pitching development of AR
in the web browser, this is a critical time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Mixed reality on the web. Real-world input into
virtual space. Geometry of tech shape how we use it, changes
innovation. Consider the evolution of the camera, from camera
obscura, brownie with viewfinder, SLR, LCD screens,
selfies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Geometry of spatial apps in HTML5.
&nbsp;Objects i the real-world that exist beyond “far” How can we
bring depth in?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Orientation and position.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Question: what about
color-blindness?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Charles LaPierre: We want to be able to allow
shifting of color spectrum, manipulated by APIs or by user. That’s
possible now. We can use VR to demo what a person with
color-blindness sees in different scenarios, and how to make it
more accessible.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: I am red-green deficient, so this is
important to me. In VR today, there’s already some post-processing,
so we could add color-shifting. Also, volumetric data.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><br>
Shannon: I worked on ARIA spec, declarative attributes on HTML DOM
tags for purposes and intents. We should look at how that can be
adapted to WebVR.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>On-click element, declarative.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>LucC: Look at solutions from “real life”,
diversity of accessibility solutions, we should make it possible to
adapt these in VR.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>JamesBaicoianu: Re post-processing, look at
CSS, users can specify styles that override the web
author.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Anssi: Declarative, learn from CSS. How do the
existing accessibility tools for the web fit into WebVR? What
abstraction layers?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Charles LaPierre: We need low-level APIs that
can interact with existing assistive tech. That exists, e.g.
braille display, tongue sensors for visualizing imagery. Where APIs
exist, you should be able to interact with those in VR. Give
developers hooks to those APIs. Personalization is a big part of
accessibility: not every blind person can read braille, so let them
work through the modes they do use.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Philip: HDR displays will introduce new issues.
Extended color gamut makes RGB look dull. Contrast ranges need to
be mapped to displays.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Casey: Lots of accessibility already built into
the browser. Use it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There’s also machine accessibility. How search
and links work.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch: I’m looking forward to VR
alt-text.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Is there a need in primitives to separate
visual from spatial? &nbsp;How do we take the interactive and
spatial components and not make assumptions about users’
characteristics?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Chris: A-Frame meant to be the JQuery for VR on
the Web. document query selector proved the value, then got
standardized and implemented.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Big q: Should every entity be represented in
the DOM?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Q from slack: klausw: accessibility:
Roomscale/6DOF has its own challenges, think about wheelchair-bound
users, people with only one arm, very short or tall people. Many of
the same accessibility/ergonomics issues as for real-world
locations. I remember having to lift up my daughter to reach the
virtual pot in Job Simulator.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: Cool utility @@.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Possibility for extension utilities to help
with common tasks, e.g. “make me taller, to reach items”. As
patterns emerge, maybe they become part of the platform.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Klaus: do we have the same expectations for all
sites? Difference between action games and shopping?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Charles: For an image, we can have a tactile
representation, but feeling it doesn’t make sense without a tour to
describe what you’re feeling.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>3D audio is great for people with visual
impairments. You can create amazing 3D audio games; so games can be

<p class="c0"><span>Justin: some preferences we’ve exposed in
WebVR, e.g sitting to standing pose. These keys can be valuable to
improve the experience. Be careful about privacy considerations. As
we tailor experience to a user in a wheelchair, are we exposing to
fingerprinting/tracking?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><br>
Q regarding text.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Justin; we’re looking at SDF fonts, we don’t
have a canned solution to improving 2d text.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brian Chirls: top-down vs responsive design. If
you take accessibility into account, you get lots of great stuff
for free. Even a person who has all the VR equipment for roomscale

<p class="c0"><span>About 22.5 years ago we pulled together enough

<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<h3 class="c0 c5" id="h.ql979d9btuup"><span>Discussion:</span></h3>
<p class="c0"><span>%%%%: A couple of the talks spoke of users and
finding them in a space. &nbsp;This requires things working
together. &nbsp;Has anyone started working on this standardization?
&nbsp;Feels like everyone’s working on their own
implementations.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Tony: We’re addressing some of that and it
seems like a service layer that’s waiting to happen.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch: How do you position people in space
where Avatars aren’t near each other. There is balancing of the
needs from many perspectives.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>#####: When we’re talking about social
interactions we’re talking smaller numbers. &nbsp;We have
differences in real world spaces. &nbsp;It doesn’t make sense to
have everyone in the world, just the 2 - 3 of your friends that
want to talk.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch: A more practical question. &nbsp;Where
do we see the authoritative database being hosted.
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Tony: Good question, who’s the authority over a
certain space. &nbsp;We hope as the problems become evident we work
on them together to solve them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>^^^^: There are a lot of projects to make data
more distributed and less centralized. &nbsp;We’ll have to see how
this evolves.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Nicoli: There was a session on latency.
&nbsp;What’s the real need, is it 100 ms or less? &nbsp;If someone
speaks to me and I don’t hear it, was it too long?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>@@@: I don’t know if it’s any easier in games,
most have a minimal latency, I think we have a lot of work to do on
this. &nbsp;We should look at game engines to learn about low
latency and figure out how to scale that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch: question about having a private UI and a
public avatar. &nbsp;Is there a way to have me see things you
can’t. &nbsp;It gets to questions of privacy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>^^^^: I think people are going to go towards
everyone seeing the same thing. &nbsp;I think several solutions
will be as literal as they can be.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Wendy: That conversation raises the question to
me of how much do we expect the environments to be end-user
customizable. &nbsp;How do I bring my own private annotations,
accessibility tools, maybe I have things I want to share with
friends.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brad: If you want to record someone’s phone
conversation you have to tell them. &nbsp;So if you were to bring
something into a VR environment and record someone else’s VR would
that be legal?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>%%%: If I try to do something in AR do I need
to worry about copyright or do I just get pixels.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom puts up list of topics that were discussed
in the session.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Discussion on the use of avatars and the
security around them</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>/missed some of this due to hearing issue and
that my laptop stopped working for a few minutes/</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Privacy/anonymity: for some users and
situations, it’s dangerous to be identified, for others, it’s
unwanted. VR needs to accommodate multiple identities and
pseudonmys/anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The Internet is composable. It’s not uniform.
Will VR be a metaverse or an Internet?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Charles: drawing on that, if you are paralyzed
you may not want to show that in VR. &nbsp;You may want to have an
alternative presentation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>#####: People react to your avatar and in VR we
need to see if people are more respectful to each other.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>@@@@: A lot of stuff being discussed here was
covered in Virtual World discussions so it will be interesting to
see how that’s changed over time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch: To what extent is the user agent going
to impose restrictions on the character model.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>%%%: The idea of smooth degradation of avatars
needs to be considered as well.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>A: a-frame intended for hand-coding, gLTF for

<p class="c0"><span>Samsung research: Encourage browser vendors to

<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Posh: reading from Slack - jank
caused by GPU uploads - what can we do?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: no great answer, but for a
lot of these things (e.g. texture uploads), there are specific
mechanisms that allow to separate out pieces in the texture upload.
Right now, you use an image tag to load an image, and once done,
you ask to browser to upload it, all of that can be blocking. What
you really need is having compressed textures all the time
throughout the pipeline, and we should expose that as a primitive
to the browser.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c7">JustinR: lots of big problems for

sending information to optimize some of these streaming concepts?
The server could optimize which slice to prepare for the
viewer.</span></p>

discover. The timelines give you beautiful graphs with very nice
clear ideas of what takes time in your apps - we've some
screenshots of that throughout the day.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Klaus: back to the room - to what

<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Justin: it's one of the bug we hit
in Chromium - I think that has been fixed in drivers</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: in WebGL 1, if you want to
use renderToTexture, you can't do multi-sample @@@. Won't be fixed
in WebGL1, but WebGL2 will fix this - but you shouldn't deal with
that type of approach for VR. For mobile devices, you want to use
well-tested techniques from the 90's, multi-path is not there
yet.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Justin: for your main rendering
process, use a simple WebGL context, especially on
mobile</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">ChrisVW: mirroring can be important
for demos esp on Desktop; what's the alternative to preserveBuffer
in that context?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Justin: for demos, that's probably
OK, although you'll find devices for which that will fail. But
don't keep it in production. It's useful for demos or development,
even debugging.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">ChrisVW: have you investigated
asm.js or WASM?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Justin: no</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: mirroring is good on
desktop, but never do it on mobile. You can chromecast content from
the headset to the TV - this would be the better mechanism, with
hardware acceleration. Don't turn preserveBuffer on on
mobile.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c7">@@@: WebVR doesn't reflect any
performance back to the app - e.g. on texture size, resolution
scale.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: we have performance
extensions for WebGL, although there is some additional cost coming
from the compositor (which we hope to be able to turn off e.g. on
mobile immersive). The concepts behind the requestIdleCallback API
of a time budget could usefully be reapplied to
requestAnimationFrame</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">@@@: we need to know how much GPU
time you have left, not CPU time</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Ricardo: what about controllers?
Will they be integrated in the gamepad API or a different
one?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: for one, we want to expose
some really basic fundamental interaction models, regardless of
what you're working with; on cardboard, the one-button interaction
should be surfaced as a touch event, which can then be replicated
in more advanced devices.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">For gamepad, we should poll all the
information at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Justin: Another crazy idea is to
keep GPU cache across navigation, assuming we have the right
conditions from a security perspective - this is critical to enable
smooth navigation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Ricardo: I'm wondering if at some
point the browsers will give us the glTF model for controllers;
right now we have to manually change this.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: OpenVR has this; I've been
wondering if we should do this, not sure how to do it in a Webby
way. It would be nice to defer to the browser and just ask for a
representation of the controller. But I'm not sure what that API
would look like - we could just resurface the OpenVR API, but we
probably want something more useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Potch: We have ServiceWorker that
can do request caching; we could have a way to get the SW to get
back the fully decoded ready-to-use asset as a response. Sounds
like a logical extension to an existing API.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">@@@: catching CPU resources across
navigation - we have very limited GPU resources, and have no
indication of back pressure from the GPU. WebGL doesn't easily let
us recover from exhausted resources. Right now we have to manage
this blindly. Regarding dynamic resolution, there is nothing in the
WebVR that tells us the target framerate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Casey: how about non-graphics
optimizations: physic, spatialized audio?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Brandon: I would love to see more
tooling around audio and making that an easier thing for developers
to get their head around. We have great engineers in the Chrome
team who do amazing things e.g. the WebVR audio sample
demonstrating spatialized audio. I would like to see more tools
that handle audio in a more user grokable way, with the best
performance outcome. We have the right primitives available, but I
find them hard to use.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">@@@: MultiView was mentioned as an
improvement for WebGL - we have a proposed breakout session for
tomorrow. Are there other acceleration extensions we would need for
VR?</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span><br>
Kfarr: Another question, there have been a number of creative (yet
competing) concepts for mixture of compression and projection
optimization to reduce bandwidth. Facebook appears to be the most
advanced in this realm so far, at least in terms of publishing
their implementations and providing proofs of concept, however they
have not open sourced any of this nor are they intended for use in
WebVr / browser environments. While some mechanisms are too
advanced at this point (such as foveated rendering based on gaze
position), there are some that are clearly effective and relatively
simple such as alternate projection styles and tile / block
compression alternatives that offer significant bandwidth savings
already. Instead of Brightcove re-inventing the wheel to make yet
another proprietary implementation thereof, can we work together to
tackle the “known good” implementations as a standard?<br>
David: we’re stuck with codecs today, experimenting with different
projections.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><br>
Kfarr: Another question, If the “new” proposed “standard” were to
include projection information in the mp4 container itself, there
is significant existing content that would not have this tag. How
would we deal with this transition period?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>

You can inject in JS. Ideally, we can get standardized</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Moderator, Olivier Théreaux, BBC; Panelists,
Hongchan Choi, Google; Mike Assenti, Dolby; Raymond Toy,
Google</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Olivier: I work at BBC. I'm here today to make
sure we're not missing half of the point of VR as Brandon put it
yesterday about audio. We have a panel here to look at the status
of audio & VR. We'll first get an update from Raymond, a lead
developer on the Chrome Team and an editor of the Web Audio API at
W3C, and will give us an update on the Web Audio Working Group,
including the Web Audio spec which does synthesis and processing.
The Working Group will soon recharter, so it is a good time to
bring input on the next version of the specification. We'll have
short presentations from each panelists, each followed by a short
Q&amp;A, but we'll also get more time after
presentations.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Raymond: This is a brief overview of the Web
Audio API. In the beginning, the Web was silent; you needed flash
or a plugin to play audio. HTML5 added the &lt;audio&gt; tag, which
allowed streaming and some limited functionality such as start,
stop, seek. But you couldn't do much beyond playing and it had
limited timing precision. 6 years ago, the Web Audio APi was
started to address these limitations and extend what you could do
in the browser. It gives you an audio graph with sample-accurate
timing with low latency. It allows you to create e.g synthesizer in
the browser. Web Midi allows you to plug your keyboard into that
procesing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The Web Audio API gives you a way to define
precisely when a source starts; in the audio graph, you get to use
lots of different processing nodes (e.g. gain, audio effects,
filters, spatial effects). Recently we have introduced the Audio
Worklet that allows you to use JavaScript to do custom
processing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Where are we going? We have a draft spec that
we are working very hard to bring it to Candidate Recommendation,
hopefully by the end of the year. We left lots of stuff on the
table to be able to move forward. We want to make the API
extensible; for VR support, what do we need beyond what the API
already provides with the panner? It seems to work pretty well
already based on the demo I saw from Brandon, but we want to hear
from you to make Web Audio useful for real immersive audio
experiences.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Q&amp;A:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: indeed, the room demo, it works really
well. One issue we've found that if you turn your head fast, it
creates discontinuity in the sound. What are your thoughts on how
to improve this?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Raymond: that was an effect of the original
panner node, but with the new API the problem should no longer
exist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Don Brutzman: in X3D, we have some experience
in spatial audio from a content definition perspective. An</span>

most players were implementing this in software. &nbsp;Suggestion:
consider setting the bar for an initial spatial-audio specification
based on current hardware capabilities, and consider defining an
even-high-fidelity spatialization for hardware folks to drive
towards. &nbsp;Potential win-win.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Raymond: it turns out a lot of the nodes are
based on OpenAL, but I'm not sure how to do more than
that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>JamesB: question about codec support - Opus is

<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan Choi: this talk tries to look at what
you can today with the Web Audio API for spatial audio. When we
looked at this in Chrome, there were 2 patterns: Object-based
spatialization - we have a basic system for this in Web Audio with
the Panner node</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c9"><a class="c4" href=
"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://toji.github.io/webvr-samples/06-vr-audio.html?polyfill%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1477062934796000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCYOmdj2iX-YxdSMtJdCLO6QqZ6A">
https://toji.github.io/webvr-samples/06-vr-audio.html?polyfill=1</a></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The next proposal is to use ambisonics - a
pretty portable audio format that can be played on any speaker
setup. We project this into binaural rendering. But this was not
part of the Web Audio feature set. We looked at how to make that
possible.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>One logical idea was to extend the
&lt;audio&gt; & &lt;video&gt; element with a magical blackbox - but
that seemed too risky.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Another approach was to use a
MediaStreamSpatialAudioNode, but this had quirks as well. We'll
probably go there at some point, e.g. in v2.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In the meantime, I started looking at doing
this using the (now deprecated) ScriptProcessorNode - it worked but
with issues with latency and glitches.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>But I took a step back, and realized I could do
this using native audio nodes - and we got a great review from
TechCrunch on the result which works in any Web Audio-enabled
browser.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>See googlechrome.github.io/omnitone</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Some issues we discovered in the
process:</span></p>
<ul class="c6 lst-kix_fmvkj3izyj78-0 start">
<li class="c0 c2"><span>We're missing a compressed audio format for
FOA/HOA multichannel audio stream; I think Opus solves
this</span></li>
<li class="c0 c2"><span>There are alternative spatialization
techniques ground on native implementations</span></li>
<li class="c0 c2"><span>Right now we have a separate rendering path
for audio and video, which means there are synchronization issues
that we need to address.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c0"><span>Olivier: we want to hear from the audience on
what is needed for VR (whether the abstraction of the audio native
nodes is right for the kind of needs of VR)</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan: not in this project; but it's a
different matter for the spec</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Chris: is this a worker friendly
spec?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan: right now the Web Audio API is not
accessible from a Worker, but we are developing this Web Audio
Worklet</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Chris: any high level library to wrap the
API?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan: tone.js is pretty popular</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Thomas: many 360 video comes with 2D sound -
any way to make it sound better nevertheless?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan: I haven't thought about
that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Philip: you mentioned orientation, position; I
would have also expected velocity, also the room environment
converted as a filter.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan: I was talking about the other
approach - what you're talking is object-based parameterized
spatialization. Ambisonics is not for that</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Potch: any support for Doppler
effect?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Hongchan: we had to remove it due to
issues</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Jason: I've done professional projects with Web
Audio - great stuff. Being able to set the drop off rate would be
useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Olivier: Mike Assenti from Dolby Labs will be
looking at a different angle, on how to use object based audio for
linear based VR experiences</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Mike: I've joined the Web Audio WG recently,
but been at Dolby for the past 8 years. I'll offer some perspective
on audio content creation on audio for linear based VR
experiences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>At Dobly, we distinguish interactive vs linear
VR experiences. Linear is a storytelling or experential (e.g. live
sport event).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>A soundfield is a description of sound at a
particular point in space, whereas an object model-based
representations describes semantically which sound (represented as
a channel) comes from where.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There are dedicated hardware for sound field
capture, but for object-based require a more onerous but more
flexible artistic mix.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>[illustrating with the diner scene of Pulp
Fiction]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>“Reality is not really what we want with
virtual reality, but an artistic experience.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Live events - one of my favorite use case, you
also need to mix the audio to make it pleasant. You would capture
this with different mic points. Doing this live is pretty complex
(which companies including Dolby are trying to help address), but
it gives you more artistic opportunities.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In a live music show, again, you want a curated
mix, not a soundfield capture.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For post produced VR, you get all these sources
that you turn into channels with metadata describing the objects
(at least the position), which can then be rendered into the
various speakers setups. This can be exported in audio formats that
support spatialization - one possible export is to render this as a
simple soundfield (although then again you lost
flexibility).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We talked about the difference between reality
& VR. Rendering distance is not just a matter of attenuation -
reverb also plays a role. You need metadata to determine e.g. if
the object is supposed to be far or near.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Professional mixers don’t want us to do the
attenuation for them, but to get control of the
primitives.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>You can also do head-track vs non head-track
audio (e.g. a commentator should be fixed to the user). You can
also increase the gain based on the gaze direction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>In a live event, you might want to do automated
panning based on the position of the artis on scene.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>You could also mix VR in VR.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Speaker-rendering is also interesting to avoid
the isolation aspect of VR.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What about the Web? We need 2 components to
play this back: decode the content and their time-synchronized
metadata, pass it to a renderer in which we pass the orientation &
position of the user, with playback configuration (e.g.
binaural).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The options to do this in Web Audio: we pass
the bitstream to the native decoder tightly bound to the renderer,
to which you pass orientation & position : but that latter part you
can't do.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Another option is to the rendering in the Web
Audio API (e.g. a series of panner nodes with reverb) - it gives
more flexibility, but it's heavy and might get
consistencies.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>VR audio is more than head-track spatialization
over headphones. Audio production is also art which need to be
combined with ambisonics for great VR experiences.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Web Audio v1 brings us very close to linear
based VR experiences, but not quite to the end - this is a feature
request for v2!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Q&amp;A</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Philip: you talked about the linear stuff; what
about the interactive stuff?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Mike: from a rendering standpoint, there is a
lot of similarities. But at Dolby, we look more at linear content
in general. But if we get it right for linear, it should apply
similarly for interactive.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Don: a useful direction for future work would
be for the 3D & audio to inform each other in VR experiences.
&nbsp;For example, high-fidelity audio rendering can likely be
accomplished for this room on the order of 100 polygons.
&nbsp;Adding audio properties for reflection/absorption etc. is
also analogous to visual materials/appearance. &nbsp;SIGGRAPH
conference is a good resource for such work, e.g.</span>

<h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.noaj6r6y94de"><span>Standardization
Landscape</span></h1>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: We’ll start our last session now. A couple
announcements; a phone was found.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Another thing, we should do a group photo of
the very first W3C Web VR Workshop.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We’ll go outside and take the photo as a memory
of the event.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Neil Trevitt: thank you W3C for organizing
this. In July 2008 I met Bill @ at SIGGRAPH who said we should do a
binding to Canvas and have eye glasses everywhere. We took it into
Khronos and now we’re here eight years later. Talking about
standards landscape. Lots of interaction between what we are doing
and what W3C is doing. Some of other standards orgs we come in
contact with.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For those of you who don’t know the background,
we share the same ideals and processes as W3C; more common than
different. We’re committed to open standards and royalty free. We
are focused on silicon software part of things. We have every GPU
vendor. Our primary activity is to figure out how to expose
acceleration for graphics, computation and vision process with APIs
and enable software to use them in real applications. We have about
120 companies.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Members keep joining each other [laughs]. How
Khronos relates to AR and VR. We do file formats. Collada is an
API. We talked about GLtF yesterday. Will save us all work and make
applications more efficient and avoid siloed content.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>WebGL is all on GitHub. GLTF Work is like a W3C
Interest Group. We also have Working Group where people have signed
up for RF. You can join and have a seat at the table. Core business
is APIs for acceleration.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Timeline for where WebGL came from. Open GL in
2008 was ubiquitous. Open GL was available on all the desktops.
OpenGL2 was becoming ubiquitous on mobile. So becoming available
anywhere Web browser was running. Test message</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>2011 WebGL1.0 launched. Four years not so bad.
WebGL2 is based on ES3; four year pipeline or heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>New stack we have been talking about. Vulcan is
the new.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><br>
Why is Khronos in WebGL? So closely linked to native API, silicon
roadmaps. Portability; need GPU guys around the table.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What other issues do we have? Lots of the
silicon guys - my day job is video - lots of VR capability,
asynchronous context. Probably cannot expose all of them. Spoke to
stereo first step. Do we want to expose more VR capability to
expose more functionality at JS level.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Cameras, in 21st century we are still running
processing on the CPU. If you can get power processing...ultimately
orders of magnitude more. Need to get vision processing off the
CPU.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Vision acceleration API. May not lift up to JS.
Perhaps people implementing trakcing might use native APIs like
Open VX. PokemonGo is awesome but dispiriting to see that the power
users must turn off the AR, because it runs better on the battery.
Silicon has failed to enable applications for AR. Apache is
available in the phones.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>One potential effort is to use GPGPU in GL12.
We’re talking more general and higher level language and access to
language not just for vision but also audio and neural nets. We’ll
want to accelerate that quickly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><br>
We have WebCL; lift into JS; still kernels in C. Learn it’s good
when a standard takes off and gets adopted, be thankful. Web CL was
one thing we tried that did not work. Perhaps a JS extension is the
way to go.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Good that the breakouts covered so much of
this. The cameras are about to become really diverse in number;
mobile phone has four. The wide angles, depth, stereo are coming.
Just controlling the camera is going to be a point of fragmentation
at JS and developer level. We have this nascent group called
OpenKCam, intended to be an abstraction for how to control the
sensor. This has not taken off yet; may not be needed. Maybe a cul
de sac, or too early. Take a look at OpenKCam. Should we
re-invigorate this group? Get lift into JS domain.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This is a cheaky slide: VulkanVR: is there a
need? We’re in a weird situation with VR SDKs. All similar but also
different. Have apps running differently. Native rendering API
things will consolidate quickly around Vulkan. @ has adopted
Vulkan. UT, Epic, are porting onto Vulkan.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Seems the differfences between these
environments are not sustaining competitive advantage. Would it be
good for that community building on all these SDKs not to have all
that friction. Not do it all differently. If the native community
gets its act together, that would make things easier to have more
consistency at native level. &nbsp;Interested in
feedback.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Slide with big chart of SDO
landscape</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>MPEG guys, video, audio, images. They have done
work on 3D compression. They do have a declarative AR framework
called ARAF.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Then OGC deals with anything around geospatial.
Tony, get Mark to look and they could help.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Here are my suggestions. We should meet like
this much more often. Discover problems that we can solve with
standards. Some don’t need, but some do.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Figure out which SDO has closest domain
expertise. Make sure they stay on track. Ensure community has a
channel to feed requirements into the SFO. Continue regular
meetings.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;[Neil ends; applause]</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: I thought I would present what could be
useful to standardize soon, longer term or never in W3C.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>First is taxonomy. Most well known standards
work is in Working Groups with formal IPR. We also have W3C
Community Groups. WG only members; CG open to anyone. VR has been
doing work in CG for now, has limited IPR commitment. We help to
facilitate incubation. We also have Interest Group. Has more
limited IPR.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Present what I heard, which is up for
discussion. What should come up soon, later or not at all. And
summarize what I heard over the past two days.</span></p>

[slide6]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>WebVR is the elephant in the room. Gamepad API
extensions. Some proposals</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Notion of having a VR mode in CSS Media Query.
Not sure if it’s close or interesting. Broader conversation. Maybe
something easy.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Notion of API that Samsung presented, putting
context around content.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Has been a lot of work around Speech
Recognition API in a Community Group</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Interest in Web timing CG for Media
synchronization; check out</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Web Assembly is a CG at W3C. Still a lot of
churn on this. VR might be another motivation to get done sooner v
later.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Mention of proposal in a CG on Media
Capabilities. May be too early and need more incubation.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>[slide7]Longer term standardization
targets?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Lot of discussion around declaratives around
mark-up. An object model. Does that impact @</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>360 media streaming we heard some approaches;
open issues there worth looking into</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Navigation Transitions; notion of
metadata</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Discussion around having a unified user input
model for VR the way pointer events simplified touch. Maybe get
something similar here</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Gesture recognition framework may be further
away; some cultural aspects; explore some primitives</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Out of my league for Web fonts for 3D
context</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Several conversations touched on scheduling
what happens very precisely. We have some mechanisms. Had some
suggestions on how to inspire @</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For accessibility can we imagine applying
ARIA.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Annotating VR entities; maybe touch
metadata</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Identity and Avatar management is at the
frontier between maybe and not at all</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>[Slide 8]</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Help?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Things where I am unclear</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>DOM to WebGL?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>What would need to standardized for 2D-Web
browsing in VR</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We want innovation in this space but there is a
cost; not have multiple viewports. Needs some
coordination</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>UI patterns. We don’t want to standardize, but
will need to be some kind of agreement on how you interact with
this space</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Social discussion around binding of real and
literal worlds in terms of authenticity, geographic control. That
is not necessarily ready for standardization, but worth
watching</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>My proposal is that we extend by a little bit.
You give us feedback on the priorities, what are the gaps. Idea is
we use this white board to more easily brainstorm.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Rob: one thing missing is the permissions,
especially in mobile. There needs to be a broader forum for
discussion. Fusion brings APIs together. How to integrate as a
whole.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: Any other feedback on standardization
landscape? Another interesting topic is there is somewhat clear
separation between what SDOs do. Are there specific overlaps to pay
attention to or carefully avoid. That would be useful.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Did we call out security explicitly?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: Wendy, do you want to talk to
that?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span><br>
Wendy Seltzer: Thank you. Security is one of the areas W3C
considers among our horizontal review areas along with
accessibility, internationalization. We look at all the specs from
this POV. Interesting to hear ways VR and Security intersect. About
authenticity and integrity of environments. How do we give them
indicators. How to deal with social interactions and recogniztions.
Great area to keep looking at.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Feature of device detection
capability.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: there was a media capabilities proposal.
Something broader like head sets?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Olivier: Mention of media capabilitiy. There
are broader questions, is this a 3D environment ready device I am
using. Seems to be a need for that.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: Capabilities. Any other input. What do you
folks think we need to standardize tomorrow or should have
standardized yesterday?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>David: WebGL is blocking certain things you
might prototype. Do it in WebVR</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: any ongoing work?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Tony: I saw a Chrome prototype from four years
ago. That’s been stuck in mud for years.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: this comes up a lot. We all need it
but have higher priorities to work on like WebGL 2. Hope to give
more attention to. Would be a nice to have. Was not so much of a
pressing need.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Tony: That TripAdvisory demo I did. Do a
rollover and you get a divet. I had to code every pop up twice. I
just wanted an element …</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Brandon: I have made my WebGL voice known and
said we need to do that now.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: Any other input?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Anssi: Either people are tired or your
proposals are near perfect</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Tony: I’d like to talk about process</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>How to best participate; tooling, etc. We can
use W3C infrastructure. What would you prefer?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>How many people use Slack? Pretty many. I guess
Slack, combined with Neil’s idea that we do this again sooner v
later. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: should we do another event like this a
year from now? [hands go up]</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Olivier: This felt like a weird workshop.
Usually people come with ‘I have a spec here’ and kind of seeing
where it sticks. This workshop a lot of topics but not a lot of new
specs. So it sounds like six months time would be good where people
come with these specs.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Wendy, W3C: I’m thinking about our strategy. We
work well with proposals for concrete work. And we have places to
help incubate things not yet at that phase. When we start a WG we
draft a charter and get patent commitments. That is a great way to
work on something that is ready to be specified and where we can
describe to your lawyers what we are going to do. When we are not
ready to do that, we have CG for incubation. We have discussions
and repositories. And help discussions broader than W3C membership
and look for when they are ready to become more solid standards.
We’re seeing there is lots of other activity and we aim to be good
colleagues with other SDOs, where we can be helpful to others. I am
excited by the energy and cooperation that we see here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Shannon: talk about follow-up. February 27 or
28 there will be a WebGL meetup on VR. I have not yet posted the
event. We’ll have someone from W3C give us an update.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>David: Seconding incubation and use in WIGC and
GitHub. Start with an explainer and not go directly to
IDL.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Phillipp: There is high performance graphics
conference covering issues that we are doing here. Consider
contributing to this. Will be be track on compiler technology. Call
for papers will be in the next month or so, deadline in April. We
invite not only academic but also industry. It’s a great venue for
a lot of the stuff we have talked about here.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Dom: Any last comments before we wrap
up?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c1"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Anssi: Progressive enhancement or mainstream to
look at? How do you apply this world?</span></p>
